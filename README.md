This app was made early on while learning SwiftUI.

All code is in the [ContentView](/Numbers/ContentView.swift) file.

Very simply made with a lot of if statements.
 It actually functions nicely.

Lottie Animation added makes it look nicer.

This is the final project.
 The app is here for reference and preservation.
